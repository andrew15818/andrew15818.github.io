As my last post was about the [books I had read in 2024]({% post_url 2024-09-01-2024Reading-List %}), I thought this 2025 I would first post about what books I *plan* to read this year. In no particular order, here it goes:

1. ***The Intelligent Investor, Benjamin Graham***: Investing and stocks seems like such a complicated field at first that I wanted time-tested method for approaching stocks. Championed by Warren Buffet, Graham introduces *value investing*, in which you buy securities that are undervalued and have a high chance of generating returns. I'm around halfway through at the moment, and I love that the book is straightforward in its logic and builds on a very simple yet easy to forget idea: the hardest part of investing is controlling your own emotions.

2. ***One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Marquez***: One of my favorite books ever, this is a tale of seven generations of the Buendía family and the founding and development of Macondo. Full of memorable lines and characters, insights into loneliness and generational trauma, this novel is as enjoyable now as when I read it in high school for the first time. This novel made me realize Spanish can be a beautiful language, and it's due for a re-read.

3. ***Ficciones, Jorge Luis Borges***: One of the most famous short-story collections in Spanish. In high school I had to read a story by his called "*The Circular Ruins*", and I admit I did not understand it at all. However, being a bit older (and hopefully wiser) I figured I could try with his most famous work.

4. ***La Increíble y Triste Historia de la Cándida Eréndira y su Abuela Desalmada, Gabriel García Marquez***: I bought this book on recommendations from friends and family, and being a big fan of Marquez, I thought I would probably enjoy it. I read the first few pages, which told a short story about an angel who falls to Earth and nearby villagers have him as a tourist attraction which draws tons of people to their small town.

5. ***Mao: The Unknown Story, Jung Chang and Jon Halliday***: A biography on Mao which I saw at a family member's home and unashamedly asked to take it. I figured since I read a beefy biography on Chiang Kai Shek before, reading a biography of Mao would make for a nice complement. From my light skimming, it seems to be pretty technical on troop movements and battles during the war, and I'm especially curious about the post-war period.

6. ***Pedro Páramo, Juan Rulfo***: A story by a Mexican author with non-linear storytelling drawing heavily from Mexican folklore. That's really all I know about it but I have had it recommended.

It's my goal to read all of these novels by the end of the year, but I honestly have doubts given the length of some of these. I'll update this list with a more in-depth opinion on each one.
