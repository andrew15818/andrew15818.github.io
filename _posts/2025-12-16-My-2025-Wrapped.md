The year is almost over, and it's a great time to look back and see how we I can rate this year. How to best describe 2025? It was actually very good!

The highlight was definitely seeing my family multiple times this year. My parents came to Taiwan for the new year and we had a blast. A few weeks later, I went back to Honduras to spend the Chinese New Year. Finally, I went back to Mexico in August for my cousin's wedding. Living abroad means many sacrifices, and there were so many family members I hadn't seen in 10+ years that I finally got to see. I had sirloin tacos in Mexico which have been living **rent free** in my head.

In the spring/summertime, I went to Hong Kong for the first time, and it marked the first trip around Asia I had taken in years. I mostly travel back to Honduras, but now that I work there are places in Asia I hope I can visit soon (looking at you Japan and Korea).
