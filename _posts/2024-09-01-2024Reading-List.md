2024 is almost over, and with it another year reading fulfilling books.
I thought for a long time how I could write a reading list or review without sounding pretentious; however, given that this page is essentially the only place online where I express myself, and this page is mostly a writing exercise, I'll just go for it.
These last two years for some reason I have read mostly fiction, whereas in my undergrad I looked down on fiction, I thought it didn't have much to offer. Maybe seeing online discussions or lectures, podcasts and so on made me realized how much depth there can be in fiction, especially the great stories.

Which brings me to my approach to books in general. I mostly enjoy reading "great" or "classic" works, and have for most of my teen/adult life. 
I find old books teach us something about the time in which they were written and about our own time as well, in a way similar to how living in another country teaches you to view your own in a new light.
They also humanize the past, where you can see the struggles and mentalities of those that came before and how in reality we are not all that different.

That being said, here's the list of books I read in 2024:
1. ***Macbeth*, William Shakespeare**: In recent years I've made a choice to read and re-read as much Shakespeare as I can. *Macbeth* (or as I call it *Macdeath*) is one of his darker tragedies, dealing with the raw desire of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth of becoming king and queen. Both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are fascinating characters: cunning, manipulative, yet ultimately, human like the readers.

The play also contains one of favorite Shakespeare passages so far, delivered by Macbeth towards the end of the play

<div class="centered-poetry">
<p> To-morrow, to-morrow and to-morrow,</p>
<p> Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,</p>
<p> To the last syllable of recorded time;</p>
<p> And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</p>
<p> The way to dusty death. Out, out brief candle!</p>
<p> Life is but a walking shadow, a poor player</p>
<p> That struts and frets his hour upon the stage</p>
<p> And then is heard no more. It is a tale</p>
<p> Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury</p>
<p> Signifying nothing.</p>
</div>
Going back to the point about reading great books, just from this soliloquy I had two "Eureka" moments:
  - Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury* gets its name from this.
  - In the summer 2024 a best-selling novel called *Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow* made headlines.

2. ***Paradise Lost*, John Milton**: An Epic poem dealing with Satan's Fall and the Genesis story. Milton's goal when writing was to make a Christian epic poem in the vein of Homer. He is so often compared to Shakespeare and Dante that I figured I'd be missing out not having read him.

Even though the Genesis story is everywhere in the West, Milton "fills in the gaps", and provides all the main characters with motivations for their actions, as well as philosophical discussions on free will, good and evil, among other interesting topics. The end result is a familiar story that still seems fresh and with the beauty of the prose, is quite a captivating story.
