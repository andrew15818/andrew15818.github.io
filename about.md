Here's a little bit more about me.

I was born and grew up in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
When I was 18 years old, I had the wonderful opportunity to come to Taiwan on a [scholarship](https://en.mofa.gov.tw/cp.aspx?n=A5C28AD214C3FD7C), which included studying one year of Chinese followed by 4 years of computer science.

After studying at the wonderful NTNU's [Mandarin Training Center](http://www.mtc.ntnu.edu.tw/eng/), I did my undergraduate in CS at **National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University** (交大).
For my master's degree I went to **National Cheng Kung University**(成大) where I studied self-supervised deep learning for my thesis.

Since November 2023, I have worked as an AI Engineer at [President Information Corporation](https://www.pic.net.tw/), where I have focused on developing a recommender system for an e-commerce platform.
