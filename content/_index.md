# Welcome to my site!
I was born and raised in Honduras, a small country in central america. 
I'm currently a master's student at National Cheng Kung University, 
with a research interest in self-supervised learning.

In 2016 I travelled to Taiwan to study Chinese for one year, followed by 
my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung
University (國立陽明交通大學).
In 2021, I started my master's degree at National Cheng Kung University (國立成功大學)
guided by professor Yao-Hwang Kuo (郭耀煌).
