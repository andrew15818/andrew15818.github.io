      <description>Self-supervised learning can sound like a real mouthful! My family and friends have asked me many times what it is I actually do for my master&amp;rsquo;s degree, and I always struggled to come up with a simple answer; an answer that really captures the idea without getting too technical.
In this post I would like to try to do just that. We&amp;rsquo;ll start by defining what supervised learning is, since self-supervised learning tries to work around the main limitations of supervised learning.</description>
